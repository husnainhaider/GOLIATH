## TL;DR
A mythic action game where **lies take form as giants**. You wield a **Resonant Sling** to reveal weakpoints and a **two-hand greatsword** to shatter them. Tight, readable boss fights, minimal filler, strong atmosphere.

## Story — The Myth of the Boast
Where crowds gather and **boasts** harden into **belief**, a **Goliath** rises.  
The city chants, orators amplify the lie, and the giant grows invincible—until a lone seeker bears the **Sword of Truth**. Your task is not to kill for glory but to **break the boast** that empowers each giant, and in doing so, free the people who built it.

### Main Throughline
- **The Lie**: Each region’s society insists on a comforting falsehood (strength, prosperity, fairness, destiny…).
- **The Giant**: The lie manifests as a colossal guardian with armor that **cannot be harmed**—until its **Truth Runes** are struck.
- **The Sword**: The blade is not legendary because it is sharp, but because it **cuts through false narratives** once the runes are revealed.
- **The Cost**: The more you expose, the more the crowd turns—**Orators** rally them; your **Chorus meter** rises and falls with public sentiment.

## Chapters (Campaign Arc)
1. **THE EMBER FELL** — A forge-yard city worships “eternal industry.” A **walking kiln-giant** vents fire through ritual runes.  
2. **THE HARBOR CROWN** — Prosperity myth rides a **crab-carrier colossus** bearing a trading citadel; ropes, banner-cranes, storm surge.  
3. **THE PALE MERIDIAN** — “Perfect fairness” enforced by a clockwork tribunal; **gear-judge** emits timed shockwaves and balance gongs.  
4. **THE SUNDERED OATH** — A pilgrimage wall where “chosen destiny” denies agency; mobile wall-mech with choir pylons.  
5. **THE SPORE CATHEDRAL** — A cult promises “healing for all”; bioluminescent **mycelium titan**, regenerative lies.  
6. **THE SWORD-BEARER** — Human rival who wields your truth against you. Amphitheatre duel; orators fall silent when **the crowd sees**.

> Each chapter pairs a **social lie** with a **mechanical loop**: reveal runes → create brittleness → commit with the sword.

## Gameplay Pillars
- **Precision → Commitment**: Hit **Truth Runes** with the sling to create short **brittle windows**, then commit to **heavy greatsword** attacks.  
- **Readable, Fair Bossing**: Big tells, cancel windows, 3-frame hit-stop on perfect interrupts.  
- **Oaths & Burdens**: Opt-in modifiers (e.g., *No Deflect*, *Harsher Chorus*). Raise your reward—raise the stakes.  
- **Orators & Chorus**: Strike orators to lower crowd pressure. The **Chorus meter** subtly tweaks boss aggression and rewards.  
- **Mercy • Seal • Corruption**: Three post-fight choices shaping NG+ routes and endings.

---

## Core Loop (One Fight)
1) **Scout**: Learn a boss phase; watch orator timings.  
2) **Interrupt**: Sling a rune → **truth-tone ping** → brittle cracks.  
3) **Commit**: Heavy connect → posture break or phase change.  
4) **Decide**: Mercy / Seal / Corruption → unlocks systems or NG+ paths.
